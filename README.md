Learning Outcomes
=================
Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.


This course is about data mining history, reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).


##Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1.	Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online
2.	Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden
3.	Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)
4.	Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations
5.	Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies
6.	Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community

## Course Structure
The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data: 
1	principles of open access research and your digital identity 
(learning outcomes 5,6)
2 Finding Data (learning outcomes 1) 
3 ‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2) 
4 First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data? (learning outcomes 1,3) 
5 Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 2,3) 
6 Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4) 

These broad steps, delivered over a regular 12 week term, include hands-on exercises, tool testing and reviews, and open collaboration between students and faculty.

The course is built so that every student makes a meaningful (and publicly acknowledged) contribution to a larger research project. Students in this course don’t just talk about digital history: they do it, modeling how best it ought to be done. Thus this course has lessons for the broader humanities community.

The data and informatics skills that students will learn in this course, as well as the theoretical and historiographical grounding they will receive, are in demand. Students who successfully pass this course will have a piece of public work that they can include in portfolios and CVs that will stand them in good stead in the broader world within and without academia. Indeed, this course is a first step in developing their online scholarly persona.
