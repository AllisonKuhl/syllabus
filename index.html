<li>subject to change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.</p>

<p>This course is about data mining history, reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).</p>

<h2>
<a id="learning-outcomes" class="anchor" href="#learning-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li> Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online</li>
<li> Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden</li>
<li> Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)</li>
<li> Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations</li>
<li> Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies</li>
<li> Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="course-structure" class="anchor" href="#course-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Structure</h2>

<p>The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data: </p>

<ol>
<li> principles of open access research and your digital identity 
(learning outcomes 5,6)</li>
<li>Finding Data (learning outcomes 1) </li>
<li>‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2) </li>
<li>First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data? (learning outcomes 1,3) </li>
<li>Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 2,3) </li>
<li>Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4) </li>
</ol>

<p>These broad steps, delivered over a regular 12 week term, include hands-on exercises, tool testing and reviews, and open collaboration between students and faculty.</p>

<p>The course is built so that every student makes a meaningful (and publicly acknowledged) contribution to a larger research project. Students in this course don’t just talk about digital history: they do it, modeling how best it ought to be done. Thus this course has lessons for the broader humanities community.</p>

<p>The data and informatics skills that students will learn in this course, as well as the theoretical and historiographical grounding they will receive, are in demand. Students who successfully pass this course will have a piece of public work that they can include in portfolios and CVs that will stand them in good stead in the broader world within and without academia. Indeed, this course is a first step in developing their online scholarly persona.</p>

<h3>
<a id="assessment-breakdown" class="anchor" href="#assessment-breakdown" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assessment breakdown:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Exercises: 30 % </li>
<li>Final project: 40%</li>
<li>Paradata document: 10%</li>
<li>Active, value-added community building by participation in the discussion(s), across mutliple media and platforms: 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no final exam in this course.</p>

<h3>
<a id="participation-20" class="anchor" href="#participation-20" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Participation: 20%</h3>

<p>That is to say, active, value-added community building by participation in the discussion(s), across mutliple media and platforms.</p>

<p>Digital history is public history. We ‘hack as a way of knowing’. Digital history is done best in the light of peer review; we will use social media to highlight the work of students, to put them in contact with other practitioners in the field, to induct them into the community of practice that also characterizes digital history.</p>

<p>As this course evolves, as digital technologies emerge, pass into and out of favour, as the theoretical aspects to what we do become better known or new vistas open, as the major overarching research project matures, new modules, new activities, will become necessary. This course will always be in a state of flux. The core values of openness, transparency, ownership, and dialogue will remain. Central to this is the reclaiming of the student’s online digital scholarly identity and participation in the agora of ideas -including ideas concerning the growth of the class- wherever that identity or agora resides online. </p>

<p>Ongoing student feedback: github features an issue tracker and a wiki on each repository; we will be using these to facilitate our connection with our students, and their connections with each other, as well as a weekly ‘Where I’m not sure’ Q&amp;A session hosted via the LMS. (As it happens, every post, issue flag, and individual commit in a repository on github gets its own unique URI thus allowing us to track and develop measures of engagement).</p>

<p>Privacy issues will be addressed by allowing all public outputs to be done using pseudonyms, under arrangement with the course instructors (while recognizing that pseudonyms run counter to the ideals of managing a scholarly identity online, online safety is a priority. Arrangements for complete behind-the-LMS-gate interactions and project work can be made on an individual basis as warranted). </p>

<h3>
<a id="exercises-30" class="anchor" href="#exercises-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exercises (30%)</h3>

<p>NB 'optional' denotes an online tutorial without the purview of this course, to add depth to that section's discussion. Evidence of completion of these may be construed as a bonus on the exercise grade of the course.</p>

<p>Each section also requires students to be actively engaging with each other’s work via the wiki and issues section of their github repositories. The course instructor monitors these by pulling all of their respective RSS into a single feed, (shared with the students via the LMS), but posts responses etc directly within the student’s repository. </p>

<p>We 'choose our own adventure' through this material. Students can select their six best exercises (one per section) to count towards their formal assessment; thus the other exercises constitute formative assessment. Indeed, this structure allows the students a great degree of flexibility in constructing their own learning path. We recognize that most of these skills and concepts will feel entirely strange to history students; we endeavour to make it ‘safe to fail’, to try different paths without fear.</p>

<p>These exercises, with instructions and guidance, will be in the course repo.</p>
