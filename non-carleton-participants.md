##Welcome

This iteration of the course is very much a *beta* version. I would welcome your participation and your feedback, but please understand that my first duty is to my enrolled students. That said, I'm *always* on [twitter](https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo) so I'm likely going to be fairly responsive!

##Expectations, or, why you should trust me
On the pro side of the leger I've been teaching online or distance education in one form or another since about 2005. I've always been interested in pedagogy and open approaches.

On the con side of the leger, I've never used github before in the manner I'm envisioning here. It's entirely possible that this whole experiment will fall to pieces. 

In the winter of 2016, I intend to transform this course in its entirety to github as an official Carleton University online course, which would be accessible to anyone who wanted to register. I expect to make mistakes this time around in preparation for the later edition.

If there are enough interested non-Carleton folks, I would be happy to arrange periodic Google Chat/Hangout sessions to talk about the materials and so on. So if you're interested, why not add your self to this document via a pull request with your twitter (or other) handle? 

We'll see how this works out.
